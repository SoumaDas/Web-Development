		<p class="content">
			Chickens have short wings and a heavy body. This makes it hard for them to fly very far. Male chickens are called roosters. Roosters often have brightly colored feathers. They can be red, green, brown, black, or other colors. Female chickens are called hens. Hens are usually brown or white. Both males and females have one or two wattles. A wattle is skin that hangs from the throat. Male and female chickens also have a comb, which is skin that sticks up from the top of the head.

		<p class="content">
			A cow is a domestic animal that can be seen in our homes. It is a four-legged animal that comes in various colours like white, black or brown. It may also have large spots on its body. A cow has two small eyes and ears, a big nose, two sharp horns and a long tail with hair at the end. Cows have strong teeth and a mouth that helps them to graze and feed on grass. They also eat husks and grains and are usually seen lazing around in open fields.

		<p class="x3">Fish</p>
		<p class="content">
			Defining a fish is difficult because the term fish includes a very wide range of aquatic animals. In fact, there are about as many species of fishes than there are of all other vertebrates combined (Fig. 4.4). Of the nearly 50,000 species of animals with backbones, approximately 4,500 are mammals, 9,700 are birds, 6,500 are reptiles, 4,000 are amphibians, and 25,000 are fishes. Although these numbers change as new species are discovered, new fishes are found more often than other new vertebrates are found.
